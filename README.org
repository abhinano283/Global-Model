#+title: Global plasma model

The global plasma model is discussed in Chapter 10.2 of Lieberman &
Lichtenberg (2005)

The code here is an extension to a multi-species plasma

The first version of the code is for an Ar/Xe plasma.  The two species
have been hard-coded into the code.

The code has been verified against the examples in Lieberman, Section
10.2.  The agreement is approximate.  This is most likely because of
differences in the calculated electron temperature (and thus rates and
energy losses).

The neutrals model and that of ion-ion plasma remains to be
implemented.
