	* particle-balance.lisp (Te-equation0): Made equation to be
	explicit in terms of ion fractions, and not in terms of the rates,
	Bohm velocity, etc
	(particle-balance-calculation0, print-Te-calc-results0): Changed
	calling argument from X-Ar to X-Xe since it seems more relevant to
	my needs

	* particle-balance-new.lisp (calc-te): Increased default root
	search range to 0.1 - 90
	(particle-balance-calculation, print-Te-calc-results): Changed
	calling argument fro X-Ar to X-Xe since it seems more relevant to
	my needs

	* global-plasma-model-package.lisp (:global-plasma-model)
	(:global-plasma-model-user): Updated package definitions

	* energy-balance.lisp (calc-ne%): New function used to unify the
	classic and new
	(calc-ne0, calc-ne): Now use calc-ne% for the explicit calculation

	* energy-balance.lisp (Vs): Using +pi+ instead of pi
